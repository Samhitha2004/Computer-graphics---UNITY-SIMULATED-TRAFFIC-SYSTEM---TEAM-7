# Computer-graphics---UNITY-SIMULATED-TRAFFIC-SYSTEM---TEAM-6
 The Traffic Simulation Project is a Unity-based autonomous system designed to replicate real-world traffic dynamics with a focus on safety, realism, and interactivity. The simulation features AI-powered vehicles that adhere to traffic signals, ensuring smooth navigation at intersections without collisions. Pedestrian interactions are seamlessly integrated, with designated walkways and strict adherence to traffic rules to maintain safety. Dynamic lighting, including streetlights, car headlights, and animated traffic signals, enhances the visual realism of the environment. Leveraging ML agents, the system manages multiple cars, enabling intelligent decision-making and collision avoidance. This project serves as a scalable solution for urban planning, education, and research, providing an engaging platform to explore traffic management challenges and solutions.

In conclusion, the Traffic Simulation Project provides a comprehensive, realistic, and autonomous system that effectively models traffic behaviors, pedestrian interactions, and dynamic lighting conditions. By integrating AI/ML agents, the simulation ensures smooth vehicle navigation, collision avoidance, and adherence to traffic rules, while also providing a safe environment for pedestrians. The inclusion of dynamic lighting, realistic intersection management, and the ability to transition between day and night enhances the overall immersion and accuracy of the simulation. This project serves as a valuable tool for urban planning, research, and education, offering insights into efficient traffic management and safety protocols in real-world scenarios.
